# WallaMarvel

A simple iOS app that fetches and displays a list of Marvel superheroes, built as part of the Wallapop iOS technical test.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Local Configuration

This project uses a `.xcconfig` file (`Config.xcconfig`) to store sensitive information like API keys. To get started:

1. Copy the example file:
```
cp ConfigExample.xcconfig Config.xcconfig

```

2. Open `Config.xcconfig` and fill in the required values
<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Config.xcconfig is ignored by git (see .gitignore) to keep sensitive data out of version control.
<br/>

### SwiftLint

This project uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure a consistent Swift style.
<br/><br/>

#### Installation:

Install via Homebrew:
```
brew install swiftlint

```

Or follow the installation instructions on the SwiftLint repository.
<br/><br/>

#### Usage:

**Automatic linting and autocorrection**: SwiftLint runs automatically during build via a **Run Script Phase** in Xcode:

```
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin"

if which swiftlint; then
    swiftlint ‚Äî-fix && swiftlint
else
  echo "warning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint"
fi

```

This script:
- Runs **autocorrection** first (`--fix`)  
- Then runs the regular lint checks  
- Issues a warning if SwiftLint is not installed
<br/><br/>

**Manual linting**: You can also run it manually in your terminal:
```
swiftlint ‚Äìfix && swiftlint

```

#### Configuration

The configuration file is `.swiftlint.yml` located at the root of the project. You can customize `.swiftlint.yml` further to suit your needs.
<br/><br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SwiftLint is **required** to build the project cleanly. If you don‚Äôt have it installed, the script will warn you.
<br/>

## ‚úÖ Testing

### Unit Testing

#### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Swift Testing** for running and verifying tests.  
- **SwiftyMocky** for automatic mock generation.
<br/><br/>

#### Installing SwiftyMocky

To generate mocks you need to install SwiftyMocky CLI.
I did with Mint but you can check other ways in [SwiftyMocky](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky) repository:

```
brew install mint
mint install MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky

```

#### Generating Mocks

The configuration for mocks generation is in the Mockfile located in the project root.
To generate or update mocks execute:

```
mint run SwiftyMocky generate

```

This will automatically generate mock classes in the specified directory.
<br/><br/>

#### Marking Protocols to Mock

To tell SwiftyMocky which protocols mock, mark them in the code with the following comment:

```Swift
// sourcery: AutoMockable
protocol SomeService { ... }

```

SwiftyMocky will detect this marker and generate a ready-to-use mock for testing.
<br/><br/>

### Snapshot Testing

For UI testing I use [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing?tab=readme-ov-file), a library that captures the visual state of views and compares them to stored reference images, alerting us to any unexpected changes in the UI.
